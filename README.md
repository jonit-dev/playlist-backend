Playlist Challenge
==========================

> Build a single page web application for creating playlists from a library of
> songs!

Included in this folder is a Node.js web server which includes an API and a
skeleton for your browser-based playlist application.

The API includes endpoints to complete the challenge. You don't need to change,
but you can if it helps.

The skeleton includes Bootstrap. Feel free to use any CSS or JavaScript
frameworks your ‚ù§Ô∏è desires.

To install and start the web server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Features
-----------------------------

Start by building out these features:

1. Load the library of songs and show it in the browser.
2. Add songs from the library to a playlist.
3. Name and save a playlist.
4. List saved playlists.
5. Load saved playlists.

If you complete the above and still have time, try one of these, in no
particular order:

* Drag 'n Drop organization.
* Search or filtering for songs.
* Sorting songs by properties like album, artist or length.

You do **not** have to do any of the following:

1. Play sounds! üéµ
2. Deal with authentication. üîê
3. Work across browsers. Pick your favourite and get it working there. üèÑ

*We reserve the right to ask you about how to implement them later üòÄ*
